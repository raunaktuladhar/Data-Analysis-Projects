# Data-Science-Projects
Here are some of the data science projects I have done by watching youtube tutorials.

#### Youtube Channel: The iScale

### Project 1: Zomato Analysis
I have analyzed the data of Zomato (food delivery) by performing `Data Preprocessing` like converting the datatype of column 'rate' from 4.1/5 to 4.1 only. I have even visualized the data in graphs. You can check the .ipynb file for more in detail.

### Project 2: Netflix Movie Analysis
I have analyzed the data of Netflix just like in Project 1 (Zomato Analysis) but it is a bit lengthy. You can check the .ipynb file for more in detail.
