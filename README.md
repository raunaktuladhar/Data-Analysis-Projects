### Project 1: Zomato Analysis
In this project, I analyzed the data of Zomato (food delivery) by performing data preprocessing tasks, such as converting the datatype of the 'rate' column from '4.1/5' to '4.1' only. I also visualized the data using graphs.

#### The tasks I performed:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Visualized insights using graphs and charts
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)

### Project 2: Netflix Movie Analysis
In this project, I analyzed the data of Netflix, similar to the Zomato analysis, but it was more extensive and involved deeper insights.

#### The tasks I performed:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualized data to find trends in movies and TV shows
